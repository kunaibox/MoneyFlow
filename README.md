## Purpose
MoneyFlow is a simple web application designed to help users keep track of their earnings based on their hourly wage. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a tool that can assist individuals in managing their finances while also serving as a motivational tool to stay productive during work hours.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this Hourly Wage Tracker stems from the desire to stay focused and motivated during work hours. It's common to experience moments of boredom or lack of motivation while working, especially for tasks that may seem repetitive or monotonous. By having a tool that dynamically calculates earnings based on work hours, individuals can visualize their progress and stay motivated to continue working.

- **Incremental Earnings Display**: Displays incremental earnings in green text, providing positive reinforcement.

## How It Works
